## Philosophy and Idea
The user interface is intended to present SDG formatted information on a map and within a list. Most importnantly, users can participate in discussions, provide feedback to city officials, or propose their own ideas. Instead of beeing just an information board, users are incentivised to go out and explore the area. As a reward, they gain more access to informational and collaboration tools. 

This would be a convenient application to access on a weekly basis while commuting, walking around a park, or meeting with friends at a restaraunt or museum. Naturally, users opinion who interact with the city infrastructure will be valued more for the upcoming city projects.
